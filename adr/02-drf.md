# Decision for using Django REST Framework

## Background

The main challenge is to generate a robust API which is going to be providing an interface around the object models.
For this, we need to use a well-documented tool, which integrates good with Django.

## Decision

For that sake, out of the few options on the market, we decided to stick with Django REST Framework, as it has a native
support with Django's entities, has a long version history, is battle-tested, and is really well documented.
